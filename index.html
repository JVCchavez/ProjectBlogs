      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <blockquote>Hello, welcome to JoJo's Bizarre. You have been granted the honor to stumble upon this webpage. Much like the reason to live, there is no explanation to why this exists.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Within this page, you will dig into various topics and projects that have come to my attention. all gathered together here, the hub, in these bizarre collections of disquiet.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Will any of this be funny? much like you, probably not. But for some reason will continue to try until that one awkward laugh to fill the void of unfortunate silence from the lame but intriguing laughing stock your face makes when you talk appears. But I'm getting ahead of myself. You are beautiful and hopefully can take a joke. Enjoy!</blockquote>
